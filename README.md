# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Netflix-Content
A comprehensive data analysis and visualization project aimed at uncovering insights from the Netflix dataset. The primary goal was to explore the content library's composition, identify trends over time, and understand the distribution of content across various categories, ratings, and countries.

This project aims to answer several key questions about the Netflix content library, such as:
- What is the ratio of movies to TV shows?
- Which countries produce the most content?
- What are the most common content ratings?
- How has the volume of content changed over the years?
- What is the typical duration for movies on the platform?

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x:** The core programming language for the analysis.
- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and exploration.
- **Matplotlib:** Used for generating all static charts and plots.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data exploration and analysis.

This will process the data and save all the generated visualizations as `.png` files in the `images` directory (or your specified output folder).
